sample.id,Mesh bag ID for a given year. These were reused each year so they are not temporally unique,,,,
stream,TOWR = expermentally warmed stream,,,,WS55 = control stream. No manipulations
block,Block number within a given stream. Note in PRE I did not block so there is only 1 estimate of K that can be derived. After PRE1 blocking allows independent estimates of K within each block,,,,
Species,"Acer = Acer rubrum (red maple), Rhodo = Rhododendron maximum (Rosebay Rhododendron), Wood = white oak wood veneer",,,,
mesh.type,Mesh size used. Coarse (total breakdown) vs fine (targets microbial decomposition),,,,
year,study year,pre = pre warming,,warm = year of warming in the TOWR stream,
date.deploy,date litter bags were deployed in the stream,,,,
date.collected,date an individual bag was retrieved from the stream,,,,
initital.dry.mass.g,initial dry mass of leaves in litter bags,,,,
days.incubated,Number of days a litter bag was in the stream,,,,
final.dry.mass.g,final dry mass of leaves,,,,
mass.loss,g of litter lost,,,,
pct.mass.remain,percent remaining of AFDM,,,,
ln.pct.mass.remain,loge of percent mass remaining,,,,
interval,date interval of collection,,,,
mean.temp,"mean temperature over a collection interval within a block. Note for PRE1 this column is blank. I need to look up if we had longitudinally placed temp sensors in PRE1 or if we just have mean temp over the stream reach. I should still be able to get a collection interval temp, but it won't be block specific. ",,,,
